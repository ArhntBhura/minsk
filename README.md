# Minsk

**Minsk** is a handwritten compiler and interpreter for a custom programming language, written in C#. It is designed to teach and demonstrate key concepts of compiler construction including:

- Lexical analysis (Lexer)
- Parsing (Parser)
- Binding and semantic analysis (Binder)
- Lowering (Lowerer)
- Code evaluation (Evaluator)
- Interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) terminal

Inspired by educational compiler projects, Minsk walks through each stage of language processing using a clean and modular architecture, built entirely from scratch.
